1. Treat the codebase like a public website
2. Move sensitive operations to a server
3. Communicate over HTTPS
4. Donâ€™t store sensitive data in local storage
5. Consider using an authentication service
6. Beef up your content security policy


You do not want to be using naked RSA encryption for messages. You need to be using a padding scheme and key wrapping like OAEP. Designing cryptographic protocols is extremely hard, and even experts who know far more than either you or I make mistakes doing it. Don't do it yourself. Use standards like JWE.


Beef up your content security policy
- Its responsibility is deciding what content can be loaded into your application and what can be executed

<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="font-src 'self' data:; img-src * data:; default-src gap://ready file://* *; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' * ; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' *">

- Prevent XSS vunerabilities

 unsafe-eval which allows for the execution of Javascript functions like eval()
